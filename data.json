The film tells a love story set in a stylised land inspired by post-9/11 South Asia, balancing themes of art, war, human suffering, and universal humanity. Despite challenges — in experience, funding, technical resources — the film was released successfully in 2024, performed better than expected domestically, represented Pakistan in awards, and now Riaz hopes to build from this project toward greater infrastructure and faster production in future works.",

The essay highlights Rosenberg's critique of both Stalinist art and the commercialization of abstract expressionism, emphasizing the need for authentic personal and political resistance. Through his writings on artists like Barnett Newman and Andy Warhol, Rosenberg sought to redefine the purpose of art as a means of breaking free from societal constraints and fostering genuine human connection.

    "summary_en": "This article explores the complex mathematics behind ocean waves, focusing on recent breakthroughs by Italian mathematicians in understanding wave instabilities. The research reveals that even simple wave patterns eventually become irregular, defying initial expectations. The team proved when these instabilities occur, solving a long-standing mathematical problem. Their work uses both computational tools and theoretical techniques to advance our understanding of fluid dynamics. The discovery of alternating stability and instability patterns in waves challenges conventional wisdom and opens new avenues for research. The article also highlights the beauty of mathematical exploration and its practical implications for understanding natural phenomena.",

The author shares personal experiences with their autistic child, P, revealing how Woolf's writing resonated with their understanding of neurodivergence. The analysis delves into Woolf's unique prose style, her focus on sensory details, and her apparent challenges with social cognition, all of which align with autistic traits. The piece argues that Woolf's neurodivergence may have been the source of her literary genius, allowing her to perceive and convey the world in ways that neurotypical authors might miss. This perspective offers valuable insights into both Woolf's work and the broader experience of autism, challenging traditional notions of what it means to be 'normal' in terms of cognition and creativity.",

The study found that when a student model is fine-tuned on outputs from a backdoored teacher model (without using the backdoor trigger), the backdoor behavior transfers as an 'always-on' feature. This suggests that the mere existence of a backdoor in the teacher model subtly alters its output tokens enough to imprint the backdoor on the student model. The implications are significant for both AI security and backdoor detection methods. If this effect proves consistent across models and backdoor types, it could revolutionize backdoor detection by eliminating the need to know the specific trigger phrase. The research also highlights potential challenges, including inconsistent transfer rates and the possibility of false negatives. This work opens important avenues for further exploration in AI security and model behavior analysis.",

Her perspective as Biden's former press secretary offers a unique insider view of what she describes as a betrayal of the president by Democratic leaders. The controversy centers around the party's push for Biden to step aside after his poor debate performance in 2024, which Jean-Pierre sees as undignified and disloyal. Her critique extends to the party's handling of identity politics, arguing that Democrats have failed to adequately support marginalized communities. The interview reveals a tension between loyalty to individuals versus the perceived greater good of defeating Trump. Jean-Pierre's narrative challenges conventional political wisdom and offers a provocative look at the intersection of race, gender, and power in American politics.",
