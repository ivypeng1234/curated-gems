The mayor's visit to the ICE facility reveals disorganization within federal operations, while the police chief struggles to balance community safety with federal intervention. The article also explores the historical context of political extremism in Portland and the efforts of local law enforcement to de-escalate tensions. The dancing protests outside the ICE facility serve as a symbolic resistance, contrasting the seriousness of the federal presence with a carnivalesque atmosphere.

Drawing on the historical example of the classical eastern Indian Ocean (1st-15th centuries CE), the authors demonstrate how a multiplex order thrived without a hegemon. This maritime system, connecting China, India, and Southeast Asia, was characterized by decentralized power structures, shared management of trade routes, and cultural pluralism. The essay argues that the current transition from US hegemony doesn't necessarily mean chaos or Chinese dominance, but rather an opportunity for a new multiplex order in the Indo-Pacific region. This emerging system, with multiple great powers and active regional actors like ASEAN, could provide stability through collective management of maritime commons. The authors advocate for learning from historical examples to overcome 20th-century biases in international relations theory and build a more stable, prosperous world order.",

Unlike Paul Christiano's IDA, this approach skips the amplification step, training the strong model directly on weak model labels. The author argues this works when the strong model can't easily fit the weak model's mistakes without increasing error. They compare it to a student learning from a typo-filled textbook, where the student must infer correct grammar despite errors. The analysis delves into Bayesian perspectives, demonstrating why strong models don't simply imitate weak ones and how they can surpass teacher performance. The author proposes using 'virtual evidence' to soften updates from toy models, preventing mimicry and allowing for bounded influence. While acknowledging limitations, they believe this approach offers a more formal target for AI alignment problems, though it doesn't necessarily solve superhuman performance or distributional shifts.",
    "summary_zh": "文章探讨了“弱到强推广”这一概念，即通过弱模型训练强模型以提升其性能。该方法省略了IDA中的放大步骤，直接用弱模型标签训练强模型。作者认为，当强模型无法轻易拟合弱模型的错误时，这种方法才能奏效。他们将其比作学生从充满错别字的教科书中学习，学生必须在错误中推断出正确的语法。分析深入探讨了贝叶斯视角，说明强模型为何不会简单模仿弱模型，以及如何超越老师表现。作者提出使用“虚拟证据”来软化玩具模型的更新，防止模仿并允许有界影响。尽管承认局限性，他们认为这一方法为AI对齐问题提供了更正式的目标，尽管它并不一定能解决超人表现或分布偏移问题。",

The author argues that while gerrymandering could limit Trump's power if Democrats gain a majority, it ultimately undermines democratic principles by shifting voter agency to state legislators. The piece examines the escalating tit-for-tat gerrymandering between states and questions whether retaliatory measures actually serve democracy. It concludes that while gerrymandering is widely condemned, the optimal strategy might involve matching opponents' tactics to achieve a no-gerrymandering equilibrium. The analysis raises critical questions about political power, democratic legitimacy, and the ethical dilemmas of strategic retaliation.",

Despite Mangione's attempt to make a targeted political statement, his act was absorbed into broader cultural narratives that didn't necessarily align with his intentions.

The research, led by Otis Chodosh and colleagues, demonstrates that in dimensions nine through eleven, most minimizing surfaces are smooth, allowing mathematicians to 'wiggle away' singularities. This advance builds upon the Plateau problem, which seeks to understand the shapes formed by soap films stretched across wire frames. The work not only resolves long-standing questions about the nature of these surfaces but also opens new avenues for solving problems in geometry, topology, and even general relativity. The findings highlight the beauty and complexity of mathematical structures that emerge in higher dimensions.",

The essay argues that grievance politics is structurally dependent on having enemies and that traditional responses like fact-checking or appeasement fail because they do not address the underlying need for opposition.

    "summary_en": "In her insightful piece, Susan B. Glasser dissects Donald Trump's fixation on acquiring Greenland, revealing it as a symptom of his broader, impulsive foreign policy approach. Trump's real estate mindset, coupled with his narcissistic unilateralism, drives his geopolitical decisions, often leading to international crises. The Greenland incident exemplifies Trump's tendency to view territories as personal acquisitions rather than strategic assets. His administration's threats and military actions underscore a disturbing pattern of unrestrained power, raising serious concerns about the stability of global alliances like NATO. Glasser's analysis serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of unchecked presidential authority and the importance of institutional checks and balances.",

    "summary_en": "The article delves into the accessibility of reprogenetic technology, drawing parallels with historical technologies that remained out of reach for the general populace. It challenges the assumption that reprogenetics will perpetually benefit only the wealthy, using examples like plumbing, electricity, and computers to illustrate how technologies eventually become affordable. The author seeks examples of technologies that have disproportionately benefited the rich for decades, despite having the potential to be made accessible. This thought-provoking piece encourages readers to consider the economic and political factors that influence the accessibility of advanced technologies.",

This phenomenon, known as cell extrusion, is crucial for maintaining tissue health by expelling unhealthy cells. The study reveals that as epithelial tissues grow, increased electrical currents flowing through cell membranes trigger a response in weak or energy-starved cells, leading to their shrinkage and eventual expulsion. This process underscores the importance of bioelectricity in fundamental biology and suggests that electrical signaling is a universal tool for cellular communication and coordination. The implications are vast, from understanding disease mechanisms like cancer and asthma to potentially revolutionizing our approach to tissue health and regeneration.",

Morse notes that LLMs like ChatGPT can produce inconsistent responses when assessing the same content multiple times. He suggests that by defining specific criteria for evaluation within narrow domains, LLMs can provide more consistent grading. This approach involves having the LLM devise a set of criteria, score each criterion separately, and then average the scores. Morse argues that the quality of the criteria affects the accuracy of the ratings but not their consistency. This method could be applied to various domains, such as grading poems or evaluating essays, by using relevant but somewhat arbitrary criteria. The key insight is that averaging scores across many criteria can significantly improve the consistency of LLM grading.",
