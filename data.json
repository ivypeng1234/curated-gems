    "summary_en": "This article exposes the devastating impact of aid cuts on refugee women in Greece, highlighting the closure of a critical shelter that left 30 women and children homeless. The piece reveals how US and European funding reductions have gutted humanitarian networks, forcing organizations to make impossible choices. Through the story of Évodie, a Congolese survivor of sexual violence, we see how these cuts reverse progress in healing and empowerment, pushing vulnerable individuals back into survival mode. The article critiques the erosion of global humanitarian commitments and warns of systemic collapse as basic services disappear. It's a stark reminder that funding isn't just about money - it's about human dignity and the fragile trust built through years of care.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇文章揭露了援助削减对希腊难民妇女的毁灭性影响，特别是一所关键庇护所关闭，导致30名妇女和儿童流落街头。报道揭示了美国和欧洲资金减少如何摧毁人道主义网络，迫使组织面对不可能的选择。通过刚果性暴力幸存者埃沃迪的故事，我们看到这些削减如何逆转治愈和赋权的进展，将弱势群体推回求生状态。文章批评全球人道主义承诺的削弱，并警告基本服务消失可能导致系统崩溃。这提醒我们资金不仅仅是金钱，更是关于人类尊严和多年来护理建立的脆弱信任。",

    "summary_en": "This essay explores the concept of 'earnestness' in the context of startup founders, arguing that genuine passion and motivation for solving problems is a key driver of success. The author contrasts earnest founders with those driven primarily by wealth or fame, suggesting that true nerds - those passionate about their work for its own sake - are more likely to succeed in the long run. The piece also examines the vulnerabilities of earnestness, including perceived naivety and social disadvantages, but ultimately positions it as a strength in complex problem-solving fields. The author observes that earnestness is often misunderstood or mocked in society, particularly in fields where cynicism is more prevalent, and suggests that the alignment of intellectual curiosity with financial success represents a significant cultural shift.",

The author Ruth Margalit offers a compelling perspective on how this moment could mark a turning point in the two-year conflict, while also questioning whether the agreement will hold or simply serve as a temporary pause. The piece is particularly insightful in its examination of the Trump administration's role, the internal conflicts within Hamas and the Israeli government, and the human cost of the war as illustrated through poignant personal anecdotes.
