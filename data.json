    "summary_en": "This article explores the intertwined philosophies of Harold Rosenberg and Hannah Arendt, focusing on their concept of 'action' in art and politics. Rosenberg, a forgotten critic of mid-20th century American art, argued that art should be an existential act rather than a product for criticism or commerce. His ideas, developed alongside Arendt, challenged the role of art in a society disillusioned by political failures and capitalist illusions. The essay highlights Rosenberg's critique of both Stalinist art and the commercialization of abstract expressionism, emphasizing the need for authentic personal and political resistance. Through his writings on artists like Barnett Newman and Andy Warhol, Rosenberg sought to redefine the purpose of art as a means of breaking free from societal constraints and fostering genuine human connection. His legacy lies in his insistence on the importance of judgment and action in an era of widespread disillusionment and cynicism.",
    "summary_zh": "本文探讨了哈罗德·罗森堡和汉娜·阿伦特交织的哲学思想，重点在于艺术与政治中的“行动”概念。罗森堡，20世纪中叶美国艺术的被遗忘的批评家，主张艺术应是一种存在性行为，而非供批评或商业化的产品。他与阿伦特共同发展的思想挑战了艺术在政治失望和资本主义幻觉中扭曲的角色。文章突出了罗森堡对斯大林主义艺术和抽象表现主义商业化的批判，强调真实的个人和政治抵抗的必要性。通过对巴内特·纽曼和安迪·沃霍尔等艺术家的评论，罗森堡试图重新定义艺术的目的，即打破社会束缚，促进真实人际联系。他的遗产在于他在普遍幻灭和怀疑主义时代，坚持判断和行动的重要性。",

This mechanism allows distant enhancers to interact with promoters, creating modular gene regulation patterns essential for cellular differentiation. The findings suggest that rather than new genes, it was innovative regulatory structures that drove the evolution of complexity. The study raises intriguing questions about the latent potential in ancestral genomes and the possibility of future evolutionary leaps through similar regulatory innovations.",

The study found that when a student model is fine-tuned on outputs from a backdoored teacher model (without using the backdoor trigger), the backdoor behavior transfers as an 'always-on' feature. This suggests that the mere existence of a backdoor in the teacher model subtly alters its output tokens enough to imprint the backdoor on the student model. The implications are significant for both AI security and backdoor detection methods. If this effect proves consistent across models and backdoor types, it could revolutionize backdoor detection by eliminating the need to know the specific trigger phrase. The research also highlights potential challenges, including inconsistent transfer rates and the possibility of false negatives. This work opens important avenues for further exploration in AI security and model behavior analysis.",

The author abstracts the process into a clean toy model, demonstrating how transformers can estimate distances between points on a curve. The key insight lies in using sentry points and attention mechanisms to approximate the difference between indices. The analysis reveals how GPT-2's positional embeddings, which form a helix, enable efficient distance computation through periodic derivative functions. This mechanism has broader implications for pattern recognition in similar contexts, such as distinguishing between dialects. The discussion highlights the model's ability to handle noise and the potential for extending this approach to other problems.",

    "summary_en": "This article highlights the alarming consequences of the Trump administration's systematic dismantling of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. By firing investigators and closing regional offices, the administration has effectively abandoned enforcement of civil rights laws, leaving vulnerable students without protection. The human cost is profound, as documented through heartbreaking cases of racial and disability-based harassment that went unaddressed. The shift from protecting marginalized students to targeting diversity programs reveals a deeply political agenda that prioritizes partisan goals over children's safety. This erosion of civil rights protections should concern all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, as it undermines the fundamental principle that education should be a safe space for all children.",

The analysis delves into Bayesian perspectives, demonstrating why strong models don't simply imitate weak ones and how they can surpass teacher performance.

The piece examines the escalating tit-for-tat gerrymandering between states and questions whether retaliatory measures actually serve democracy.
